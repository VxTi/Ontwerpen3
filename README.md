A school project for Electronical Engineering.

The purpose of this project is to make certain tasks in households more automated.
Therefore, the project contains the following  automated features:
- Lights turning on/off whether there's motion detected
- Temperature, humidity and air quality measurements (PM2.5, PM10, CH4 & CO2)
- Window opening/closing, determined by the environmental properties inside the house (air quality, temperature, humidity)

If one wants to use any of this code, one must install `avrdude` on their computer first
Once that's done, you should be in possession of an ATxmega256a3u chip/SoC for this to work (Possible to get it working on other chips by changing some of the #define tags)

Note that this project has been abandoned, since it was only necessary for one class.
